# ecg-data-visualization-in-plotly
This project visualizes real-time ECG data with stimulus annotations using Python, Pandas, and Plotly. Interactive plots allow users to explore ECG signals while marking stimuli like "Calm -> Beach" or "Shark Attack" in distinct colors. Users can highlight specific stimuli for detailed analysis, making it ideal for research and educational use.
